# skillbulb
This repository tells about our project where we are using both and software development and data functions integrations
Basically, a user uploads their resume and connects their GitHub profile.
 Our system will read through that, find out what skills they have, what they’re missing, and then give them career suggestions—like what job roles might suit them best.
If they don’t have certain skills needed for that job, it will also tell them what to learn next
It even looks into their GitHub projects to see how well they code, what type of tech they use, and how active they are.
The goal is to create something that feels like a career mentor, showing the right path, telling what’s missing, and helping them grow.
We’re doing this using a mix of frontend, backend, machine learning, NLP, and Azure, and the best part—we’re learning all these skills together while building the project."
